PP Generator is a tool that enables the end-user to load creatives over an iframe window, which displays a website of choice. Allowing the user to take screenshots of that creative as it was being served by that website.

For any bugs or enhancements please create an issue [here](https://github.com/mrpbennett/pp-generator/issues) and I will take time to look them over.
